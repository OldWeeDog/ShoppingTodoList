Uni Project
This is an app that's to be built for a UNI project.
The app will be suitable for any general user from highschool age upwards. 
However, it maybe especially useful for families doing the weekly shopping trip in order to keep track of the weekly shopping outgoings. 
It will basically be an installable notepad / to do /shopping list app with particular focus on the shopping list portion,
combined with a notification / reminder. To remind people to do stuff because people have such busy lifestyles these days.
